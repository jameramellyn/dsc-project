ah you know, sometimes you forget\\nMaybe a bit too ѕoon, your little oath of loyаlty', \"Sleep, my love\\nThe sun is still far from the day\\nWe have all the time to love\\nAnd the night understands us\\nSleep, my love\\nProtected by my arms that surround\\nYour sleep with a curtain of happiness\\nSleep onto my heart\\nI'm a king that holds his whole kingdom in his fingers\\nAnd that shivers of seeing this enchanted kingdom falling down\\nSleep, my love\\nMy princess, locked up in her tower\\nWith all the refrains of the night\\nMy sleepy princess\\nI'm following your soul step by step on its way of joy\\nAnd I amuse myself by leaning over your starry sleep\\nSleep, my love\\nThe sun is still far from the day\\nWe have all the time to love\\nAnd the night understands us\\nSleep, my love\\nProtected by my arms that surround\\nYour sleep with a curtain of happiness\\nSleep onto my heart\\nI hear the voice of your life that beats so close to me\\nAnd I feel like a very gentle blow that caresses my cheek\\nSleep, my love\\nMy princess, locked up in her tower\\nI see the morning smile\\nHere's the sun of tomorrow\\nThe great ѕun of the eternаl love\", \"Don't be so drowsy with that eternal paper\\nDon't yawn from sleep or boredom\\nI'm your wife and I eat out of your hand\\nBut I don't eat from charity\\nDon't look at me as if you think: 'are you still alive?'\\nAm I still that woman\\nWith whom you once - when was it again? -\\nWanted to have that little adventure at all costs?\\nBe nice once again, just like then\\nAsk me once again for a kiss\\nBring me roses again, blush again\\nWhen you see me, just like then\\nBe nice and gallant once again\\nFind me beautiful and charming again\\nThen the world will be just like before\\nA fairyland\\nYes, you're getting fat and your hair is turning grey\\nBut you still can flirt, believe me\\nAh, sometimes you act like a child, so silly\\nGruff and wanton by turn\\nDo you remember? Do you remember? Don't say no now\\nDo you remember, that you said then?\\nThe happiest couple, that's the both of us\\nMy love, dearest darling, never ends\\nBe nice once again, just like then\\nAsk me once again for a kiss\\nBring me roses again, blush again\\nWhen you see me, just like then\\nBe nice and gallant once again\\nFind me beautiful and charming again\\nThen the world will be just like before\\nA fairyland\\nBe nice and gallant once again\\nFind me beautiful and charming again\\nThen the world will be juѕt like before\\nA fairylаnd\", \"(Refrain of love…)\\nRefrain, colour of the sky, the scent of my twenties\\nGarden full of sun where I spent my childhood\\nEverywhere I've been looking for you, my distant love\\nWaiting along the path where you took my hand\\nThe days passed away and we grew up\\nLove wounded us, time cured us\\nBut lonesome and without spring\\nI run in vain through the woods, the fields\\nSay, do you remember our old loves?\\nThe years pass away as quick as lightning\\nAnd upon the roofs of my concern pours the rain\\nWhere did the caravels leave, stealing my heart\\nCarrying my dreams away from your memory?\\nI wanted you to come back like bygone\\nCarrying flowers to my shutter\\nAnd your youthfulness to my home\\nRefrain, colour of the rain, regret of my twenties\\nSorrow, melancholy not to be a child anymore\\nBut lonesome and far from you, along the roads where you аre not\\nI go, crying the loves of my twentieѕ\"]\n"
