1,Switzerland,The Code,Nemo,591,2024,"Welcome to the show, let everybody know
I'm done playing the game, I'll break out of the chains
You better buckle up, I'll pour another cup
This is my bohème, so drink it up, my friend
Uh, uhh
This story is my truth
I, I went to hell and back to find myself on track
I broke the code, oh ohh
Like ammonites, I just gave it some time
Now I found paradise
I broke the code, oh ohh
Let me tell you a tale about life
'Bout the good and the bad, better hold on tight
Who decides what's wrong, what's right
Everything is balance, everything's light
I got so much on my mind and I been awake all night
I'm so pumped, I'm so psyched
It's bigger than me, I'm getting so hyped, like
Uhh
Let me taste the lows and highs
Uhh
Let me feel that burning fright
This story is my truth
I, I went to hell and back to find myself on track
I broke the code, oh ohh
Like ammonites, I just gave it some time
Now I found paradise
I broke the code, oh ohh
Somewhere between the 0's and 1's
That's where I found my kingdom come
My heart beats like a…
Somewhere between the 0's and 1's
That's where I found my kingdom come
My heart beats like a drum
I, I went to hell and back to find myself on track
I broke the code, oh ohh
Like ammonites, I just gave it some time
Now I found parаdiѕe
I broke the code, oh ohh"
2,Sweden,Tattoo,Loreen,583,2023,"I don't wanna go
But baby we both know
This is not our time
It's time to say goodbye
Until we meet again
'Cause this is not the end
It will come a day
When we will find our way
Violins playing and the angels crying
When the stars align then I'll be there
No I don't care about them all
'Cause all I want is to be loved
And all I care about is you
You stuck on me like a tattoo
No I don't care about the pain
I'll walk through fire and through rain
Just to get closer to you
You stuck on me like a tattoo
I'm letting my hair down
I'm taking it cool
You got my heart in your hand
Don't lose it my friend
It's all that I got
Violins playing and the angels crying
When the stars align then I'll be there
No I don't care about them all
'Cause all I want is to be loved
And all I care about is you
You stuck on me like a tattoo
No I don't care about the pain
I'll walk through fire and through rain
Just to get closer to you
You stuck on me like a tattoo
Oh I don't care about them all
'Cause all I want is to be loved
And all I care about is you
You stuck on me like a tattoo
I don't care about the pain
I'll walk through fire and through rain
Just to get closer to you
You stuck on me like a tattoo
All I care about is love
Oh oh oh
All I care about is love
You ѕtuck on me like a tаttoo"
3,Ukraine,Stefania,Kalush Orchestra,631,2022,"Stefania mother mother Stefania
The field blooming up, and she turns gray
Sing me a lullaby mom
I want to hear your native word
She rocked me, gave me a rhythm, and probably they do not take away the strength of will out from me, because she gave
She probably knew more than Solomon
I will always come to you by broken roads
She will not wake me, she not woking me in strong storms
She will take two diddly-squats from her mother like they are bullets
She knew me very well, she was not being deceived, she rocked me when was very tired
Luli Luli Luli…
Stefania mother mother Stefania
The field blooming up, and she turns gray
Sing me a lullaby mom
I want to hear your native word
I'm not in diapers but ma no ma, enough, I must pay for things no matter how I grew up
I am not a child, but she still loses her temper, I walked, the slag would hit you
You are still a young mother at the peak if I do not appreciate the care at the peak of glory to me in a dead-end
Kill the peak of this peak, I would burn the peak, with your love
Luli Luli Luli…
Stefania mother mother Stefania
The field blooming up, and she turns gray
Sing me a lullaby mom
I want to hear your native word

Sing me a lullaby mom
I want to hear your nаtive word"
4,Italy,Zitti e buoni,Måneskin,524,2021,"They don't know what I am talkin' about
Dirty clothes, bro, muddy clothes
Yellow 'cig stains on my finger
I am walkin' with my 'cig
Excuse me, but I truly believe
That I can make this jump
And even if the road is uphill
That's why I am training now
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
Bring out the actors
You'd better not make anymore mistakes
You'd better be quiet and behave
Around here, there are strange people-like dealers
Too many nights I've spent locked outside
Now I'm kicking these doors
Eyes up like climbers
So excuse me mum if I'm always out, but
I'm out of my mind, but different from them
And you are out of your mind, but different from them
We are out of our minds, but different from them
We are out of our minds, but different from them
I've written pages and pages
I've seen the salt then the tears
These machine-men
Not climbing the rapids
I've written on a tombstone
In my house there's no God
But if you find the sense of time
You'll climb out of your oblivion
And there's no wind stopping
The natural power
From the right point of view
You feel the thrill of the wind
With wax wings on my back
I'll seek that high
If you want to stop me try again
Try cutting my head off because
I'm out of my mind, but different from them
And you are out of your mind, but different from them
We are out of our minds, but different from them
We are out of our minds, but different from them
They talk, unfortunately people talk
They don't know what they talk about
You, bring me where I stay afloat
Cause here i can't breathe
They talk, unfortunately people talk
They don't know what they are talkin' about
You, bring me where I stay afloat
Cause here I can't breathe
They talk, unfortunately people talk
They don't know what they are talkin' about
You, bring me where I stay afloat
Cause here I can't breathe
But I'm out of my mind, but different from them
And you are out of your mind, but different from them
We are out of our minds, but different from them
We аre out of our mindѕ, but different from them
We're different from them"

6,Netherlands,Arcade,Duncan Laurence,498,2019,"A broken heart is all that's left
I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
I'm afraid of all I am
My mind feels like a foreign land
Silence ringing inside my head
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home
I spent all of the love I saved
We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game
Aah, aah
Ooh, ooh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
How many pennies in the slot?
Giving us up didn't take a lot
I saw the end before it begun
Still I carried, I carried, I carry on
Aah, aah
Ooh, ooh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
Aah, aah
Ooh, ooh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
I don't need your games, game over
Get me off this rollercoaster
Aah, aah
Ooh, ooh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
Aah, aah
Ooh, ooh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a loѕing gаme"

8,Portugal,Amar pelos dois,Salvador Sobral,758,2017,"If anyone ever wonders about me
Tell them I have lived solely to love you
Before you I only existed
Worn out and with nothing left to give
My love, listen to my pleas
I beg you to come back, to want me again
I know that one can't love by oneself
But maybe with time you will learn to love me as well
My love, listen to my pleas
I beg you to come back, to want me again
I know that one can't love by oneself
But maybe with time you will learn to love me as well
If your heart won't be wiling to give in
Won't be willing to feel or to suffer
Without making plans of what will come ahead
My heart can love for both of us inѕteаd"
9,Ukraine,1944,Jamala,534,2016,"When strangers are coming
They come to your house
They kill you all and say
We're not guilty, not guilty
Where is your mind? Humanity cries
You think you are gods but everyone dies
Don't swallow my soul
Our souls
I couldn't spend my youth there
Because you took away my peace
I couldn't spend my youth there
Because you took away my peace
We could build a future
Where people are free
To live and love
The happiest time, our time
Where is your heart? Humanity rise
You think you are gods but everyone dies
Don't swallow my soul
Our souls
I couldn't spend my youth there
Because you took away my peace
I couldn't spend my youth there
Because you took away my peace
I couldn't spend my youth there

I couldn't have my homelаnd"
10,Sweden,Heroes,Måns Zelmerlöw,365,2015,"Don't tell the gods I left a mess
I can't undo what has been done
Let's run for cover
What if I'm the only hero left
You better fire off your gun
Once and forever
He said go dry your eyes
And live your life like there is no tomorrow son
And tell the others
To go sing it like a hummingbird
The greatest anthem ever heard
We are the heroes of our time
But we're dancing with the demons in our minds
We are the heroes of our time
Heroes
But were dancing with the demons in our minds
Heroes
We are the heroes of our time
Heroes
But were dancing with the demons in our minds
Heroes
The crickets sing a song for you
Don't say a word don't make a sound
It's lifes creation
I make worms turn into butterflies
Wake up and turn this world around
In appreciation
He said I never left your side
When you were lost I followed right behind
Was your foundation
Now go sing it like a hummingbird
The greatest anthem ever heard
Now sing together
We are the heroes of our time
Heroes
But we're dancing with the demons in our minds
Heroes
We are the heroes
(We keep dancing with the demons)
(You could be a hero)
Now go sing it like a hummingbird
The greatest anthem ever heard
Now sing together
We are the heroes of our time
Heroes
But we're dancing with the demons in our minds
Heroes
We are the heroes of our time
Heroes
But were dancing with the demons in our minds
Heroes
We аre the heroeѕ"
11,Austria,Rise Like a Phoenix,Conchita Wurst,290,2014,"Waking in the rubble
Walking over glass
Neighbors say we're trouble
Well that time has passed
Peering from the mirror
No, that isn't me
Stranger getting nearer
Who can this person be
You wouldn't know me at all today
From the fading light I fly
Rise like a phoenix
Out of the ashes
Seeking rather than vengeance
Retribution
You were warned
Once I'm transformed
Once I'm reborn
You know I will rise like a phoenix
But you're my flame
Go about your business
Act as if you're free
No one could have witnessed
What you did to me
Cause you wouldn't know me today
And you have got to see
To believe
From the fading light I fly
Rise like a phoenix
Out of the ashes
Seeking rather than vengeance
Retribution
You were warned
Once I'm transformed
Once I'm reborn
I rise up to the sky
You threw me down but
I'm gonna fly
And rise like a phoenix
Out of the ashes
Seeking rather than vengeance
Retribution
You were warned
Once I'm transformed
Once I'm reborn
You know I will riѕe like a phoenix
But you're my flаme"

How many times can we break the rules?
Between us – only teardrops
How many times do we have to fight?
How many times till we get it right?
Between us – only teardrops

How many times can we win and lose?
How many times can we break the rules?

I kinda liked a girl I knew
She was mine and we were sweethearts
That was then, but then it's true
I'm in love with a fairytale
Even though it hurts
'Cause I don't care if I lose my mind
I'm already cursed
Every day we started fighting
Every night we fell in love
No one else could make me sadder
But no one else could lift me high above
I don't know what I was doing
When suddenly, we fell apart
Nowadays, I cannot find her
But when I do, we'll get a brand new start
I'm in love with a fairytale

The courage that's inside's gonna break my fall
Nothing's gonna dim my light within

It will never be impossible
Not today

Mission to keep climbing
Nothing else can stop me if I just believe
And I believe in me

Tell me that I can't, try to turn me around
I won't let them put my fire out, without no
But if I keep going on
It will never be impossible
Not today
Yes, I've got something to believe in
As long as I'm breathing

Open every door
Turn unthinkable to reality

After you, I'll have wet eyes
Empty hands, a joyless heart
With you, I've learnt to laugh
And my laughs only came by you
After you, I'll only be the shadow
Of your ѕhadow, аfter you"
54,Monaco,"Un banc, un arbre, une rue",Séverine,128,1971,"We all have a bench, a tree, a street
Where we cherished our dreams
We all have a bench, a tree, a street
A childhood that has been too short
One day or another we have to leave
To build a future, a future
And it's the unforgettable instant
When we return our child clothes, child clothes
Everyone goes, filled with hope
On the road that they chose, that they chose
To the richness or to the glory
Yet what our life will be, our life
We all have a bench, a tree, a street
Where we cherished our dreams
We all have a bench, a tree, a street
A childhood that has been too short
Everyone, in his corner of the horizon
Only defends their ambitions, their ambitions
But if we share nothing
What will be left for us in common, in common?
We all have a bench, a tree, a street
Where we cherished our dreams
We all have a bench, a tree, a street
A childhood that has been too ѕhort
Lalala lala…
Lala lala lala…
Lalala lalala lalа…"
55,Ireland,All Kinds of Everything,Dana,32,1970,"Snowdrops and daffodils, butterflies and bees
Sailboats and fishermen, things of the sea
Wishing wells, wedding bells, early morning dew
All kinds of everything remind me of you
Seagulls and aeroplanes, things of the sky
Winds that go howling, breezes that sigh
City sights, neon lights, grey skies or blue
All kinds of everything remind me of you
Summertime, wintertime
Spring and autumn too
Monday, Tuesday, every day
I think of you
Dances, romances, things of the night
Sunshine and holidays, postcards to write
Budding trees, autumn leaves, a snowflake or two
All kinds of everything remind me of you
Summertime, wintertime
Spring and autumn too
Seasons will never change
The way that I love you
Dances, romances, things of the night
Sunshine and holidays, postcards to write
Budding trees, autumn leaves, a snowflаke or two
All kinds of everything remind me of you
All kindѕ of everything remind me of you"

Which is sung when you were born and also on your farewell

For the hours darling, darling, darling
Our love was beautiful, so beautiful
Thank you, darling
Don't be sad, as I have to leave you
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Your tears are painful, so painful, so painful
Our dream flies away, away
Thank you, darling
Don't cry, also that serves a useful purpose
Look ahead, not back
You can't force luck
Because no sea is as wild as love
Only love can be like that
Be like that, be like that
Thank you, thank you, thank you
For the hours, darling, darling, darling
Our love was beautiful, so beautiful
Thank you, darling
So beautiful, so beautiful
Thank you, darling
So beautiful, ѕo beautiful
Thank you, darling
Thаnk you"
60,Luxembourg,"Poupée de cire, poupée de son",France Gall,32,1965,"I'm a wax doll, a rag doll
My heart is engraved in my songs
Wax doll, rag doll
Am I better, am I worse than a fashion doll?
I see life in candy pink
Wax doll, rag doll
My records are a mirror
In which everyone can see me
I'm everywhere at once
Broken in a thousand pieces of voice
Around me, I hear the rag dolls laughing
Those who dance to my songs
Wax doll, rag doll
They give in to a yes, to a no
Love is not only in songs
Wax doll, rag doll
My records are mirrors
In which everyone can see me
I'm everywhere at once
Broken in thousand pieces of voice
Alone, sometimes I sigh
I say to myself: ""What good""
""Singing about love this way for no reason""
""Without knowing anything of boys?""
I'm nothing but a wax doll, but a rag doll
Under the sun of my blonde hair
Wax doll, rag doll
But one day I'll live my songs
Wax doll, rag doll
Without fearing the warmth of boyѕ
Wax doll, rаg doll"

I'm not old enough to love you

I wouldn't have anything to say
Because you know many more thingѕ than me

While I'm waiting for that day to come
But not now

I'm not old enough to love you

62,Denmark,Dansevise,Grethe & Jørgen Ingmann,42,1963,"A ray of sunshine in a puddle
A little kiss on the cheek from a wind
And the rush, humming
That life's beginning
Its web in your mind
A whistle of silver from a treetop
A faint sound of a cat grabbing
A ripple in the stream
A whisper in the hedge
That says, that it isn't night anymore
The meadow is wet with dew
Lady Dawn goes to bed
Day gets up playfully
And crosses the bridge of the sun
And the two of us?
What about the two of us?
Yes, what about the two of us, you and me?
I'm dancing and dancing and stopping
And sensing only you
Why ever did you run away?
Come back, come back
Come back, you my beloved friend
Come back, come back
Wherever you wish, are we dancing to
Come, let us dance
Everything can happen
Come, let us dance
Let us dance, let us laugh
A whistle of silver from a treetop
A faint sound of a cat grabbing
A ripple in the stream
A whisper in the hedge
That says, that it isn't night anymore
The meadow is wet with dew
Lady Dawn goes to bed
Day gets up playfully
And crosses the bridge of the sun
And the two of us?
What about the two of us?
Yes, what about the two of us, you and me?
I'm dancing and dancing and stopping
And senѕing only you
Why ever did you run away?
Come back, come bаck
Beloved friend"
63,France,Un premier amour,Isabelle Aubret,26,1962,"A first love, first love, first love
Is never forgotten, never forgotten, never forgotten
A first love, we always look for it
In other loves, we pursue it our whole life
It confused us and made us dream and made us tremble
That first love, first love, first love
But the child that we are, the child that we remained
Will always hum in memory of this love
And you, and you who I loved
What did you make of yourself?
What have you done without me?
And I, I who lost you
What have I done more?
Was I so much more lucky?
Did we actually know…
That a first love, first love, first love
Is never forgotten, never forgotten, never forgotten?
That a first love, we always look for it
In other loves, we pursue it our whole life?
That all those kisses that we have stolen rather than given
Those innocent gestures engaged us for so long?
No, the children that we still were back then
Didn't suspect much, they were delighted
That a first love, their first love wаs so ѕtrong"
64,Luxembourg,Nous les amoureux,Jean-Claude Pascal,31,1961,"We, the lovers – they want to separate us
They would like to prevent us from being happy
We, the lovers – it seems that it's hell
That watches us or else the iron and the fire
It's true, the idiots and the evil ones
Harm us, do bad things to us
However nothing is more obvious than love
We, the lovers, we can do nothing against them
They are a thousand and we are two, the lovers
But the hour is going to ring on the least difficult nights
And I could love you without them talking about it downtown
It's promised, it's written down
We, the lovers – the sun shines for us
And we sleep on the knees of the Good Lord
We, the lovers – He gave us the right
To be happy and to be joyful together
Then, the without-loves, the mis-loved
It will be necessary that we pay back
Those who hаve never been condemned
We, the lovers, we're going to live without you
For the sky is with us, the loverѕ"
65,France,Tom Pillibi,Jacqueline Boyer,32,1960,"Tom Pillibi has two castles – the first one in Scotland
Tom Pillibi has two castles – the other one in Montenegro
He also has two ships which go to the end of the world
To search for gold and corals and the most beautiful jewels
He's lucky – Tom Pillibi
And I think that I'm his girlfriend
He's so rich, that I envy him
He's so rich – blasted Tom Pillibi
Tom Pillibi has two secrets, which he won't tell anyone
Tom Pillibi has two secrets – I'm the only one who knows them
The king's daughter smiles to him and waits for him in her bedroom
The king's daughter smiles to him and the shepherdess too
He's lucky – Tom Pillibi
And I think that I'm his girlfriend
Which good star is looking after him?
Which good star? – Blasted Tom Pillibi
Tom Pillibi has only one fault, but it's nothing serious
Tom Pillibi has only one fault, but it's not such a big thing
He's charming, he's kind-hearted, he has so much courage
He's charming, he's kind-hearted, but he's such a liar
Because nothing exists of all that
But I don't care when I'm in his arms
Because I'm the queen of the big country
Where he takes me to – blаѕted Tom Pillibi"
66,Netherlands,Een beetje,Teddy Scholten,21,1959,"I wanted your heart to be a closet with a little door
And that I could look in the little interior
Then you had to be sincere, good or bad, but true
And then you'd soon say, when I asked: ""Are you faithful?""
A bit, everyone is in love at least once, you know that
You want to be sensible, but you forget that
As soon as you listen to what Amor whispers
Then you know, it will be something like Faust and Gretchen
With little rendezvous in a little café
And strolling in the moonshine
With smell of roses
And kissing goodbye at the door
The night is blue, you whisper mouth to mouth
I swear eternal allegiance to you
A bit, you were in love more than once, mister, you know that
Your heart came up with a little idea more than once
You were sorry, but ah you know, sometimes you forget
Maybe a bit too soon, your little oath of loyalty
But actually, I'm happy that my heart has no door either
Because you never know what may live there in the interior
I'm willing to promise, when we get engaged
And you ask: ""Are you faithful?"", I'll never say to you…
With smell of roses
And kissing goodbye at the door
The night is blue, you whisper mouth to mouth
I swear eternal allegiance to you
A bit, you were in love more than once, mister, you know that
Your heart came up with a little idea more than once
You were sorry, but ah you know, sometimes you forget
Maybe a bit too ѕoon, your little oath of loyаlty"
67,France,Dors mon amour,André Claveau,27,1958,"Sleep, my love
The sun is still far from the day
We have all the time to love
And the night understands us
Sleep, my love
Protected by my arms that surround
Your sleep with a curtain of happiness
Sleep onto my heart
I'm a king that holds his whole kingdom in his fingers
And that shivers of seeing this enchanted kingdom falling down
Sleep, my love
My princess, locked up in her tower
With all the refrains of the night
My sleepy princess
I'm following your soul step by step on its way of joy
And I amuse myself by leaning over your starry sleep
Sleep, my love
The sun is still far from the day
We have all the time to love
And the night understands us
Sleep, my love
Protected by my arms that surround
Your sleep with a curtain of happiness
Sleep onto my heart
I hear the voice of your life that beats so close to me
And I feel like a very gentle blow that caresses my cheek
Sleep, my love
My princess, locked up in her tower
I see the morning smile
Here's the sun of tomorrow
The great ѕun of the eternаl love"
68,Netherlands,Net als toen,Corry Brokken,31,1957,"Don't be so drowsy with that eternal paper
Don't yawn from sleep or boredom
I'm your wife and I eat out of your hand
But I don't eat from charity
Don't look at me as if you think: 'are you still alive?'
Am I still that woman
With whom you once - when was it again? -
Wanted to have that little adventure at all costs?
Be nice once again, just like then
Ask me once again for a kiss
Bring me roses again, blush again
When you see me, just like then
Be nice and gallant once again
Find me beautiful and charming again
Then the world will be just like before
A fairyland
Yes, you're getting fat and your hair is turning grey
But you still can flirt, believe me
Ah, sometimes you act like a child, so silly
Gruff and wanton by turn
Do you remember? Do you remember? Don't say no now
Do you remember, that you said then?
The happiest couple, that's the both of us
My love, dearest darling, never ends
Be nice once again, just like then
Ask me once again for a kiss
Bring me roses again, blush again
When you see me, just like then
Be nice and gallant once again
Find me beautiful and charming again
Then the world will be just like before
A fairyland
Be nice and gallant once again
Find me beautiful and charming again
Then the world will be juѕt like before
A fairylаnd"
69,Switzerland,Refrain,Lys Assia,—,1956,"(Refrain of love…)
Refrain, colour of the sky, the scent of my twenties
Garden full of sun where I spent my childhood
Everywhere I've been looking for you, my distant love
Waiting along the path where you took my hand
The days passed away and we grew up
Love wounded us, time cured us
But lonesome and without spring
I run in vain through the woods, the fields
Say, do you remember our old loves?
The years pass away as quick as lightning
And upon the roofs of my concern pours the rain
Where did the caravels leave, stealing my heart
Carrying my dreams away from your memory?
I wanted you to come back like bygone
Carrying flowers to my shutter
And your youthfulness to my home
Refrain, colour of the rain, regret of my twenties
Sorrow, melancholy not to be a child anymore
But lonesome and far from you, along the roads where you аre not
I go, crying the loves of my twentieѕ"
